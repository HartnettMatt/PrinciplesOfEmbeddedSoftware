# PrinciplesOfEmbeddedSoftware

### Author: Matt Hartnett

## Overview
This repository contains all my work for the graduate-level course **Principles of Embedded Software**. The course is designed to equip students with the necessary skills for professional embedded software development, focusing on hands-on C programming and embedded system design. Through this repository, you'll find solutions to coding assignments, project work, and any additional material relevant to the course.

### Course Description
Embedded systems are integral to various industries, including automotive, medicine, and industrial processes. This course emphasizes the interaction between software and hardware, with a deep dive into the C programming language as used in resource-constrained embedded environments. Key topics include:

- Real-time performance and resource constraints
- Embedded development environments (version control, cross-compiling, debugging)
- Advanced C programming techniques
- Embedded software architecture and hardware interfacing
- Peripheral and device driver integration
- Memory management and optimization
- Scheduling algorithms and power-performance trade-offs
- Numerical programming for embedded systems

The course focuses on hands-on projects with biweekly coding assignments and a final project, all of which will be stored here.

### Repository Structure

- `/assignments`: Contains biweekly coding assignments demonstrating embedded systems concepts.
- `/projects`: Final project and other major deliverables.
- `/docs`: Course notes, documentation, and additional references.
- `/tools`: Scripts and utilities used for development, testing, or debugging.

### Getting Started

To run any of the code in this repository, you'll need the following:
- **Development Environment**: A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`), a cross-compiler if needed, and debugging tools (e.g., `gdb`).
- **Embedded Target**: Many assignments are designed for resource-limited embedded hardware; ensure you have the correct platform and toolchain setup for cross-compilation.
- **Version Control**: Code is versioned using `git`; ensure your environment supports this for easy version control.
